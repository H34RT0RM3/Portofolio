  <!-- About Me -->
  <h1 id="about">About Me</h1>
  <p>
    My name is Nahyan Ibn Hasan, and Hello Kids International School has me for a student. I am currently studying within Grade 4. I made this website at this early stage. Ever since I did start to use computers, I became very interested in just how websites, apps, and games are made. That interest ignited my education in technology and coding. I find joy in learning of new things I find joy in solving of problems and I find joy in computers since I am very creative. I aspire to turn into a professional software engineer one day as well as create amazing apps, websites, and programs able to aid people around the world. It is quite a big dream, I do know. I'm ready for hard work, though, learning until I achieve that dream. My first personal website was made by me in Grade 4. I am pleased to share it with you now.

  <p>
    I have a lot of experience playing different types of games, and over time, they have become a big part of my life. My favorite types of games are parkour, racing, and creative building games. These games are not only fun but also very helpful for developing skills like thinking, planning, and solving problems quickly.
  </p>

  <p>
    One of the games I enjoy the most is <strong>Minecraft</strong>. In Minecraft, I explore big worlds, build amazing structures, and play parkour maps that test my jumping and timing skills. It teaches me how to use logic and creativity to solve puzzles and build things that look cool and work well.
  </p>

  <p>
    Another game I really like is <strong>Crashday Redline Edition</strong>. It‚Äôs a fast-paced racing game where I can drive cars, crash, do stunts, and enjoy powerful action. I love how the game feels realistic, and it gives me the excitement of driving while also needing fast thinking and quick reactions.
  </p>

  <p>
    <strong>Roblox</strong> is also one of my top favorite games. Roblox is not just one game‚Äîit‚Äôs thousands of games in one! I can play obstacle courses, adventure missions, racing, and even role-play. I also like that many Roblox games are made by other kids and teenagers.
  </p>

  <p>
    Through these games, I've learned more than just how to play‚ÄîI've learned how to focus better, how to make fast decisions, how to think logically, and how to be creative. I've even started to understand some basic coding ideas by seeing how these games work.
  </p>

  <p>
    Gaming has also improved my hand-eye coordination, teamwork, and patience. When I fail a level or challenge, I don't give up‚ÄîI try again and again until I get better.
  </p>

  <p>e
    Overall, playing Minecraft, Crashday Redline Edition, and Roblox has been a fun and educational experience. I don't just play to win‚ÄîI play to learn, to improve, and to get inspired. These games helped me discover my love for technology, and they are a big reason why I want to become a software engineer in the future.
